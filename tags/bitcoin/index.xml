 Incentive The mechanism to motivate nodes join the Bitcoin network and create blocks.
Incentive 1: Block Reward Creator of block gets to * include special coin-creation transaction in the block * choose reciptient address of this transaction (Of course, it is the miner&amp;rsquo;s address)
Explanation: Because the coin-creation transaction is just like other transaction in that block, it will only be valid if the created block ends up in the consensus chain, it&amp;rsquo;s the incentive which encourages the nodes to be honest, otherwise they can&amp;rsquo;t get their rewards.</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hash-pointer&#34;&gt;Hash Pointer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hash Pointer is comprised of two parts:
* Pointer to where some information is stored
* Cryptographic hash of that information&lt;br /&gt;
The pointer can be used to get the information, the hash can be used to verify that information hasn&amp;rsquo;t been changed&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hash-function&#34;&gt;Hash Function&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hash function is a mathematical function:&lt;em&gt;H(X)=Y&lt;/em&gt;
* H:  A hash function which takes an input value and calculates an output value
* X: Input of the hash function, it could be any data of any length
* Y: Output of the hash function: a fix-size bit(, it can be 256, 384, 516 &amp;hellip;, Bitcoin uses 256)

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-i-get-into-this&#34;&gt;How did I get into this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed the buzzwords “Bitcoin” and “Blockchain” for a while. There are lots of articles, news, and talks around them. It seems that many people believe that cryptocurrency is the future of online payment, some even claim that blockchain would become the fundamental technology of the next generation of the Internet.
