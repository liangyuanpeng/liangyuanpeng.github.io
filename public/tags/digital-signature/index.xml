 Incentive The mechanism to motivate nodes join the Bitcoin network and create blocks.
Incentive 1: Block Reward Creator of block gets to * include special coin-creation transaction in the block * choose reciptient address of this transaction (Of course, it is the miner&amp;rsquo;s address)
Explanation: Because the coin-creation transaction is just like other transaction in that block, it will only be valid if the created block ends up in the consensus chain, it&amp;rsquo;s the incentive which encourages the nodes to be honest, otherwise they can&amp;rsquo;t get their rewards.</description>
